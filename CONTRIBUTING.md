#### Styleguide:

- run autopep8 before commit
- use functions that are already defined
- try to follow the following structure:
  - init functions
  - /gp/ call functions
  - main control functions (record, mode, tag...)
  - media
  - metadata/status everything else
- always test your changes with a camera
- python3.6 and newer only!
